## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure your token has read/write permissions
- Check that your token hasn't expired
- Make sure you're using the right Trello account

### Board/List Not Found
- Verify board/list IDs are correct
- Check that you have access to the board
- Use `get_boards` to see available boards

### Rate Limiting
- The server respects Trello's rate limits
- If you hit limits, wait a moment before retrying
- Consider reducing the frequency of requests

## API Limits

Trello API has the following limits:
- 300 requests per 10 seconds per API key

The server handles these limits gracefully with proper error messages.
